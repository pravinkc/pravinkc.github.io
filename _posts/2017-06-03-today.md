In my last post, I mentioned about my GSoC project with Fedora; [Centralized Metrics generation](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Summer_coding_ideas_for_2017).

Let's take up [fedmsg](http://www.fedmsg.com) first.

## Fedmsg ##

It is a python package. It defines a brokerless architecture to send messages between different apps in the ecosystem. Inspired by Debian.
Raw feed available via datagrepper - https://apps.fedoraproject.org/datagrepper/raw

It is really easy to print out the datafeed or even to push messages to the bus.

Several components of Fedora:
  * koji - the build system.
  It is the software that builds RPM packages for the fedora project. Packagers use the koji client to request package builds.
  * fedpkg
  The primary interface to the packaging system.
  * pkgdb
  This is the package database

How we can make the projects work with each other is simple. One project subscribes to a topic and provides a callback function that is called when the event occures.

## Architecture

There are several ways to make this happen. One is the AMQP protocol. This protocol needs a central broker to pass messages. It receives messages from the **producers** and sends them over to the **consumers**. This introduces a single point of failure.

Then there is the serverless architecture, **0mq** (aka zmq, ZeroMq etc)

Each producer streams over a port and the consumer listens on that port for the messages. This will increase the throughput a lot.

But the problem here is service discovery.
How does a project know where to look for messages. What endpoint, what port?

Fedmsg keeps a raw text file of producers and their endpoints and ports.

The event topics follow a certain rule:

    `org.fedoraproject.ENV.CATEGORY.OBJECT[.SUBOBJECT].EVENT`

This is the topic rule, apart from this, the body of the message also follows certain rules.

## Bus topology

![Fedmsg bus](https://github.com/pravinkc/pravinkc.github.io/raw/master/assets/topology.png "Fedmsg bus")

`(the bus)` is an NxM connection mesh -- where each consumer can connect to the producer it wants messages from. If you want to get messages from everyone, i.e. to get all the messages, subscribe to every consumer.


## datagrepper

In production, datagrepper depends on [datanommer](https://github.com/fedora-infra/datanommer) which takes in all the messages in fedmsg and puts them in a postgres DB.
This makes the life of datagrepper very easy. It is just a flask app that has various endpoints for docs and one endpoint where it sends over the filters to datanommer and parses and returns the result.

```python
    try:
        # This fancy classmethod does all of our search for us.
        total, pages, messages = dm.Message.grep(
            start=start and datetime.fromtimestamp(start),
            end=end and datetime.fromtimestamp(end),
            page=page,
            rows_per_page=rows_per_page,
            order=order,
            users=users,
            packages=packages,
            categories=categories,
            topics=topics,
            contains=contains,
            not_users=not_users,
            not_packages=not_packages,
            not_categories=not_categories,
            not_topics=not_topics,
        )

```

Looks like I will have to look at datanommer to get a feel for how to subscribe to all the topics of the fedmsg.


## datanommer

"A message sink for fedmsg"

It is comprised of only a fedmsg consumer that stuffs every message in a sqlalchemy database.
There are also a handful of CLI tools to dump information from the database.

There are 3 components.

### datanommer.commands

  * datanommer-create-db
  * datanommer-dump
  * datanommer-stats
  * datanommer-latest

Basically commands to interact with the database with ORM

### datanommer.consumer

Just subscribes to all the topics

```python
class Nommer(fedmsg.consumers.FedmsgConsumer):
    topic = "*"
    config_key = 'datanommer.enabled'
```

Dependencies:

  * `fedmsg-relay` - relay connections from active loggers to the bus

      it is a service which binds to 2 ports, listens for messages on one and emits them on the other
      fedmsg-logger requires that an instances of the relay be running somewhere

  * `fedmsg-hub` - all-purpose daemon

      listen to every endpoint discovered by `fedmsg.config` and forward the messages to locally-declared consumers.

  * `fedmsg-logger` - emits the log messages to the fedbus

```python
    def _log_message(self, kw, message):
        if kw['json_input']:
            msg = fedmsg.encoding.loads(message)
        else:
            msg = {'log': message}

        fedmsg.publish(
            topic=kw['topic'],
            msg=msg,
            modname=kw['modname'],
        )
```

### datanommer.models

This package contains the SQLAlchemy data model for datanommer.

```python
class BaseMessage(object):
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    msg_id = Column(UnicodeText, nullable=True, unique=True, default=None, index=True)
    i = Column(Integer, nullable=False)
    topic = Column(UnicodeText, nullable=False)
    timestamp = Column(DateTime, nullable=False, index=True)
    certificate = Column(UnicodeText)
    signature = Column(UnicodeText)
    category = Column(UnicodeText, nullable=False)
    username = Column(UnicodeText)
    crypto = Column(UnicodeText)
    source_name = Column(UnicodeText, default=u"datanommer")
    source_version = Column(UnicodeText, default=source_version_default)
    _msg = Column(UnicodeText, nullable=False)
    _headers = Column(UnicodeText)
```
