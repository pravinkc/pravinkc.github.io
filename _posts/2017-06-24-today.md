Python `setuptools` is amazing. It allows your programs to expose itself to the command line or to other programs.

If you want to expose to command line, do this:

```python
entry_points={
    'console_scripts': [
        'cursive = cursive.tools.cmd:cursive_command',
    ],
},
```

Now, you can use the `cursive` command on the cmd after pip installing this package.

You can also expose the program under a certain namespace:

```python
    entry_points = {
        'my_ep_group_id': [
            'my_ep_func = myns.mypkg.mymodule:the_function'
        ]
    },
```

Here, from any other python program, you can get access to this function using this:

```python
import pkg_resources

named_objects = {}
for ep in pkg_resources.iter_entry_points(group='my_ep_group_id'):
   named_objects.update({ep.name: ep.load()})


# call the function like so
named_objects['my_ep_func']()
```


This is exactly what is being used in statscache as well.
The plugins need to register themselves under the `statscache.plugin` namespace in the `statscache_plugins` repo and `statscache` will just pick them up from there.

```python
    for entry_point in pkg_resources.iter_entry_points('statscache.plugin'):
        try:
            entry_object = entry_point.load()
            # the entry-point object is either a plugin or a collection of them
            try:
                for entry_element in entry_object:
                    init_plugin(entry_element)
            except TypeError:
                init_plugin(entry_object)
        except Exception:
            log.exception("Failed to load plugin from %r" % entry_point)

```
