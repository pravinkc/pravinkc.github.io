This is so nice of Github to host static pages for free. 

Combine this with free unlimited open repository hosting. 

Combine this with free CI tools like Travis, Circle. 

Combine this with all the wonderful opensource projects one can contribute to. 

Combine this with the all wonderful folks ready to help you along the way. 

Combine that with all the benefits you get of working with the best and of learning from them. 

Can anything be better?
