I am selected for Google Summer of Code 2017 with Fedora organization!
I will be working on [Centralized Metrics generation](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Summer_coding_ideas_for_2017).

I will be involved in refactoring the metrics infrastructure of Fedora. We already have a unified message bus, which is used to pass messages between applications and computer systems even if the projects use different languages and reside on different platforms. This is implemented in the project [fedmsg](http://www.fedmsg.com).

But the problem is interacting with fedmsg. Currently, we have several projects that query the bus directly and generate reports, stats etc with that. This can be done in a better way; enter [statscache](https://github.com/fedora-infra/statscache). It sits on the fedmsg bus and listens to all the messages. 

The benefit of statscache is that it is extensible, that is to say, it is modular and allows plugins to be built that extend and complement it's functionality. My main work will be porting various free floating fedmsg scripts to statscache plugins.

My plan for the first week is porting [fedora-stats-tools](https://github.com/fedora-infra/fedora-stats-tools) plugin.
 - Port fedora-stats-tools as a statscache plugin.
 - Write tests for the plugin
 - Write documentation for statscache
 - Write documentation for plugin

Let the coding begin!
